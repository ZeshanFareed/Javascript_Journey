This repository showcases my JavaScript learning journey, covering core concepts like variables, functions, arrays, DOM manipulation, events, form validation, and AJAX. It includes hands-on practice tasks and mini projects built using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to strengthen practical development skills.
